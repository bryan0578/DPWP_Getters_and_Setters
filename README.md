# DPWP_Getters_and_Setters
##Very short Python script written for a school project
This is a Python project I created while attending Full Sail University. We used getters and setters to calculate students final grade by adding all grades and then getting the average. The app was tested using Google App Engine Launcher which has now been deprecated and google has moved to cloud services for the App Engine. The code is also checked to meet all pep8 guidelines for Python programming.
